export const aboutMeText = `My name is Roman Lewis, I am currently enrolled at Lewis University as a Junior 
and am aspiring to be a software engineer! I have always enjoyed the outdoors and recently went to the Grand Canyon with my family!
Enrolling in college has allowed me as a student to explore my interests and passions, and has given me the opportunity to learn more about
computer science as a whole. Being able to work with different professors and programming languages has been excellent in providing me with the 
tools needed to grow as a student and developer. I truly enjoy this field and cannot wait to see where this takes me!
